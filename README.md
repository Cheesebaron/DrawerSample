DrawerSample
============

A couple of samples showing the Drawer Navigation pattern and the SlidingPane Layout recently added in the Support packages.

The [Drawer Navigation sample](http://developer.android.com/training/implementing-navigation/nav-drawer.html) is ported from the original documentation.

The SlidingPane Layout sample is ported from [this sample repository](https://github.com/mastro/android-support-library-archive/blob/master/samples/Support4Demos/src/com/example/android/supportv4/widget/SlidingPaneLayoutActivity.java).
